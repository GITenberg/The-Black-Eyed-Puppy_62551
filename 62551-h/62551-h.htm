<p class="ph1">THE BLACK-EYED PUPPY</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">I</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; AM a little white, rough-haired dog, with a
black spot around one eye, and black ears
and tail.</p>

<p>I am about the size of a terrier or a spaniel, but
I&#8217;m not really either. At one time I thought I
might be a poodle, but then it turned out I wasn&#8217;t.
I&#8217;m just not any special kind of dog. My mother
wasn&#8217;t any special kind either. She was a smooth-haired
white dog. Fan was the only one of us
puppies that looked like mother.</p>

<p>There were five of us. There were Rover and
Fanny, and Jack and Snip, and then me. My
name was Smarty, but it isn&#8217;t now.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>We belonged to a man named O&#8217;Grady. It
was he who gave us our names, and he named me
Smarty because I was so smart. He said I was
the smartest puppy he had ever seen. I heard him
telling someone that. He said, &#8220;Why, that pup
can almost talk; I believe he understands every
word I say.&#8221; Of course I didn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s what
he said. I did understand a good deal, though.</p>

<p>I was the only one of the puppies that he kept.
He gave the others away to different people. He
kept only mother and me. Mother was getting
sort of old and cross. She used to growl when
I tried to play with her.</p>

<p>Mr. O&#8217;Grady used to play with me in the evenings
while he smoked his pipe. He called it playing,
but it was rough sort of play. Sometimes he
made me yelp. And he used to blow tobacco
smoke in my face. I hated that. It made me feel
sick.</p>

<p>He spent part of the time teaching me tricks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
He taught me to sit up and beg, and to roll over
and keep quiet when he said &#8220;dead dog,&#8221; and to
hold something on my nose until he gave the word,
and then to throw it up in the air and catch it.</p>

<p>He liked to make me show off before people
when they came in in the evenings. They seemed
to think I was very smart. I wonder what they
would have thought later on when I belonged to
Mr. Bonelli and was really a trick dog and acted
on a stage, with crowds of people there to look on!</p>

<p>There was one trick I had that nobody taught
me. It just came to me naturally. I had a way
of lifting my lips when I was pleased and drawing
them back so that I showed all my teeth. Mr.
O&#8217;Grady called it grinning. Everybody seemed
to think that the funniest trick of any that I did.</p>

<p>As it turned out later, that <i>was</i> the best trick of
all. Things would have been very different with
me if I hadn&#8217;t had that trick of grinning.</p>

<p>When I was big enough Mr. O&#8217;Grady began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
take me to the factory with him. The factory was
the place where he went to work.</p>

<p>He would tie me in the factory yard and leave
me there until the noon hour when he and the other
men stopped working to eat their dinners. Then
he would come for me and take me in where they
were. The men used to throw me scraps from
their dinner pails. I liked that, but after they had
finished eating they would begin to tease me.
They thought it was funny, but I used to get so
mad at them I felt like tearing them to pieces; but
I was only a puppy and couldn&#8217;t really hurt them,
so they thought that was funny too.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it was a cold day in winter&mdash;it seemed
to me they teased me worse than ever before. I
just yelped at them, I got so mad.</p>

<p>When the whistles blew for the men to go back
to work Mr. O&#8217;Grady took me out in the yard
again and tied me to the post. &#8220;There! You stay
there and cool off your temper,&#8221; he said. Then
he went back into the factory again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>But I wasn&#8217;t going to stay there. I made up
my mind to run away and go to live with someone
else, where I wouldn&#8217;t be teased.</p>

<p>I took the piece of twine he had tied me with
between my teeth and gnawed and gnawed, and
presently, in a very little while, I gnawed it in two.</p>

<p>I ran over to the fence and squeezed through
a hole, and then I was out in the open street.</p>

<p>I ran on gaily down the street, sometimes on
three legs and sometimes on four. I didn&#8217;t know
exactly where I was going, but it was fun to run
along all by myself, and not have to follow at the
heels of anyone.</p>

<p>Presently I came to an open alley gate. I went
inside and found a garbage can that smelled of
things to eat. I pawed it over and had a fine time
hunting among the scraps, but presently a woman
came to the door and shouted at me to get out.
She had a broom in her hand, and she seemed cross
so I ran out into the street again in a hurry. I
didn&#8217;t even stop to take a bone with me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>A little farther down the street I met another
puppy. He was just about my size and we made
friends and had a fine play together, but someone
opened a door near-by and called to him to come
home, and he ran away and left me.</p>

<p>It was growing late now, and getting colder too.
The wind was so sharp it made me shiver. It had
begun to snow, and it kept snowing harder and
harder, and the wind blew the snow in my eyes till
I could hardly see where I was going.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d better find some place where I
could creep in and keep warm until morning, and
then maybe I would go home again. I knew Mr.
O&#8217;Grady would be sorry because I had run away.
But then he oughtn&#8217;t to have let the men tease me
the way they did. And he had laughed when they
did it, as though he thought it funny, instead of
telling them to stop.</p>

<p>I had come now to a street where all the houses
were big and had big windows with lights shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
out of them. They all had brown stone steps going
up to their front doors. Down under these
steps were other doors. These other doors were
lower than the street, and had steps going down to
them. I found afterwards they were called basement
doors, but I didn&#8217;t know it then. I thought I
would get down in one of these basements and
wait there till it stopped snowing. Anyway, I
would be out of the wind.</p>

<p>I ran down the first steps I came to and crouched
against the door. It wasn&#8217;t very warm there, but
anyway it was better than being up in the street.</p>

<p>It kept on getting colder and colder, and I felt
so lonesome that presently I began to whine.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d only been whining a little while when I heard
something inside the door snuffing at the crack, and
then a low growl.</p>

<p>I put my nose down to the crack and I sniffed,
too, and then I could tell by the smell that there
was a dog on the other side of the door. I whined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
again, and then I heard <i>two</i> dogs snuffing at the
crack. They both growled in an angry way, and
first one and then the other began barking. They
barked louder and louder.</p>

<p>Someone inside opened the door right quick before
I expected it, and both the dogs came rushing
out at me, barking fiercely.</p>

<p>They were only little dogs, but they made such
a noise they scared me. I yelped and ran up the
steps to the street as fast as I could, with them
after me.</p>

<p>I thought they would certainly bite me, but someone
called to them and they ran on down the steps
again, looking back to bark at me once or twice.</p>

<p>After they had gone in the house again I didn&#8217;t
know what to do. I was afraid to go down in any
of the other basements for fear some other dogs
might get after me.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_008fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>I howled and howled.</i></p>

<p>I stood there shivering for a while, and then I
went up the brown stone steps and got in a corner
of the doorway there. The wind was so cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I was so lonesome and miserable that I began to
howl. I howled and howled, and the snow blew
against me, and all up and down the street there
didn&#8217;t seem to be anything alive but me.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the door I was leaning against
opened. It opened so quickly that I almost fell
over backward.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood a man, looking down at
me. A boy was peeping around the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is, father, down in the corner,&#8221; cried
the boy.</p>

<p>The man stooped and picked me up by the scruff
of the neck, and lifted me into the hall and shut
the door. &#8220;The poor miserable little beast,&#8221; he
said. I was so cold I could hardly stand.</p>

<p>The boy knelt down beside me and patted me.
&#8220;He&#8217;s almost frozen,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He <i>would</i> have been frozen by morning. Take
him down and put him in the laundry, and tomorrow
we&#8217;ll see what we can do with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could keep him,&#8221; said the boy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>He got up and coaxed me along the hall, and I
followed him as best I could, but I was so stiff I
could hardly move.</p>

<p>He took me down some steps and into a big
room that had hardly anything in it, but it was
warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you stay here,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
get you something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran away, shutting the door after him, but
presently he came back again with a plate of food
and set it down before me.</p>

<p>I was so hungry I ate and ate. &#8220;Why, you poor
little fellow,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you&#8217;re almost starved.&#8221;
And then he said, &#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll call you Ragamuffin,
and Rags for short. Or no; I&#8217;ll call you
Muffins. That&#8217;s a good name. Poor little Muffins!
Good Muffins!&#8221;</p>

<p>I wanted to tell him my name was Smarty, but
I was busy eating, and then he wouldn&#8217;t have
understood me anyway.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>All the while I was eating I kept wagging my
tail to show him how pleased I was, and when I
finished the last scrap I looked up in his face
and licked my lips and grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you cute little fellow!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;You&#8217;re grinning!&#8221; He seemed to think it was
just as cute as everybody else did.</p>

<p>He patted me and praised me, and then he
went away and got a piece of carpet and folded
it up and put it in a corner of the room for a bed
for me to sleep on.</p>

<p>I was so full and comfortable that I went right
over and curled up on it, and then I looked up at
him and wagged my tail and grinned again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do <i>hope</i> I can keep you, Muffins,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;you&#8217;re so cunning.&#8221; And he patted me
again and then he went away and left me, and I
was so sleepy I just sighed and shut my eyes and
went to sleep, and never knew anything more until
it was morning again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN I first opened my eyes I hardly
knew where I was. Then I remembered.
I was in the laundry, and I
hadn&#8217;t had any breakfast yet. It was lonesome
there, all by myself. I began to whine and yelp.
I yelped louder and louder. Presently I heard
somebody coming. I cocked my head on one side
and listened, and then I began to wag my tail for
I felt sure it was the boy. And it was.</p>

<p>He opened the door and came in, and patted me
and made a fuss over me. &#8220;Poor Muffins,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Poor boy! Poor little fellow! I know you were
lonesome. Come on, boy! Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way out and up the stairs, and I
followed close at his heels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>We went along a hall and into a big bright room
that smelled of food. Some people were sitting
at the table eating&mdash;two of them. There was the
man I had seen the night before and a lady. The
boy called her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, mother!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a cunning
little fellow? Mayn&#8217;t I keep him? Please say
I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tommy!&#8221; said the lady. And then I
didn&#8217;t hear her say anything else, because two little
dogs rushed out from under the table and began
barking at me. They were the very same dogs
that had chased me out of the basement the night
before. There was another little dog, and she
barked, too, but she stayed under the table.</p>

<p>The dogs came at me and I thought they were
going to jump on me, so I barked and showed my
teeth, but Tommy drove them away, and the lady
called to them and hit at them with a white cloth
she had in her lap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>The gentleman said, &#8220;Take him away, Tommy.
Shut him up somewhere until after breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I was taken downstairs again and shut up in
the same room where I had been before, but the
boy brought me some breakfast,&mdash;all I could
eat, so I didn&#8217;t mind.</p>

<p>I did hope I was going to stay and not be sent
away, and that I could be Tommy&#8217;s dog and not
have to go back to the O&#8217;Gradys&#8217;. I loved that
boy and he loved me, and I wanted to be his dog.</p>

<p>And so I was. Somehow I had been afraid the
lady would send me away, but she didn&#8217;t; not just
then, anyway. I stayed and stayed, for days and
days and days and days.</p>

<p>The lady didn&#8217;t like me much, and the dogs
didn&#8217;t like me at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_014fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The boy brought me some breakfast.</i></p>

<p>The names of the three dogs were Prince Coco
and Bijou and Fifine. Prince Coco was rather old
and fat. Fifine was a snappish little dog. I
liked Bijou best, but they were all very proud
and haughty with me. They were the kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
dogs that are called Pekinese. They said that was
the finest kind of dog that any dog could be, and
Prince Coco told me he and the others were very
handsome and worth a great deal of money.
(Money is what you give to people when you want
to get something from them.)</p>

<p>He asked me what kind of a dog I was, and I
had to tell him I didn&#8217;t know, I guessed I wasn&#8217;t
any particular kind of a dog; and after that they
were prouder with me than ever. Fifine said she
thought it was very hard that they should have to
associate with such a common little dog as I was.
She said it was something she had never expected
to do.</p>

<p>Prince Coco never was friendly with me, but
Bijou was sometimes, if the other dogs weren&#8217;t
there; but as soon as they came in he treated me in
just the same sort of proud way the others did. It
didn&#8217;t make me very happy, but I didn&#8217;t mind
much.</p>

<p>One day Fifine was talking again about my being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
there. She was talking to Prince Coco, and
I was under the sofa pretending to be asleep, but
she knew I heard her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why our mistress
allows him to stay,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s not at
all like any dogs I ever associated with before.
He&#8217;s just like those common little dogs we see
running about the street when we go out riding
in the automobile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Coco yawned and stretched and rolled
over on his side. &#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t worry about
that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be here much longer
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears when I heard that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Fifine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard the mistress talking this morning when
Mary was brushing my hair. She said Tommy
seemed so fond of &#8216;the little stray&#8217; (as she called
him) that she hadn&#8217;t had the heart to send him
away just yet; but soon Tommy would be having
a holiday and then they were all going off for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
visit, and William was to give Muffins to a friend
of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>(William was the man who made the automobile
go, and Mary waited on the mistress.)</p>

<p>When Prince Coco said that I jumped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy won&#8217;t let them send me away,&#8221; I
barked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! so you weren&#8217;t asleep after all,&#8221; said
Prince Coco in his lazy voice; and Fifine snarled,
&#8220;Just pretending!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was pretending,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and I heard
all you said, and if you think Tommy&#8217;s going to let
them send me away you&#8217;re mistaken, so you needn&#8217;t
be counting on that!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then I marched out of the room and didn&#8217;t
stop to hear anything else they might say. But for
all that I spoke up that way, so bravely, I was
worried, and I went upstairs and crawled in under
Tommy&#8217;s bed and lay there till he came home; and
then when I heard him I ran down to meet him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and we had such a fine play that I forgot all about
what Prince Coco had been saying. As long as
Tommy loved me and kept me with him, I didn&#8217;t
care what any one else said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TOMMY had to go to school every day,
and while he was away I either stayed
in the house or played in the backyard.
I had some bones out there and an old rubber ball
someone had thrown over the fence, and I played
with them. Now and then a cat scrambled up on
the fence and walked along it, and I barked at
the cat.</p>

<p>Once one fell off in our yard and I almost caught
it, but it put up its back and spit at me, so I thought
I&#8217;d better not, and it ran up the fence again and
jumped over into the next yard.</p>

<p>The other dogs never would play with me. I
think maybe Bijou would have liked to but he
was ashamed. The other dogs seemed to think it
was common to play.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Mary used to take them out for a walk in the
street every day, with a leather strap fastened to
each of their collars so they wouldn&#8217;t run away or
get lost. I wished I could go too; but she never
took me. It must have been fun out in the street,
but I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to be held by a strap.</p>

<p>Tommy had given me a very pretty collar. It
was red and had a bright buckle. The other dogs
were disgusted because I had one. They said only
fine dogs such as they were ought to have collars,
and that it was absurd for me to have one too. But
I didn&#8217;t care. I felt very proud that Tommy had
given it to me. It made me seem more his dog
than ever.</p>

<p>I tried to make friends with Tommy&#8217;s mother,
but she didn&#8217;t seem to want to be friends with me.
His father used to speak to me sometimes, and
once or twice he patted me. He said I was a funny
little dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_020fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>I wished I could go too.</i></p>

<p>There was a big room they called the drawing-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
It had soft rugs and big soft chairs and
sofas, and there was almost always a fire in the fireplace.
The other dogs often went in there and
slept in front of the fire or on the furniture. I
tried to do it once or twice too, but always someone
came and drove me out just as I got settled, and
James was so cross about it that I stopped going in
there after a while. James was the man who
worked about and did things with the food. They
called him a butler.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the afternoons, ladies and gentlemen
came to the house to visit Tommy&#8217;s mother.
They went in the drawing-room and laughed and
talked, and Mary or James would carry in a tray
with plates of cakes, and cups, and saucers and
things. Fifine said it was afternoon tea, but I
smelled cake, too.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mary came and called the other dogs
and took them in there, but she never called me.
Once I tried to go along, but she drove me back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and Prince Coco snarled at me. Often, when Mary
took them in, I would hear the ladies cry, &#8220;What
perfect little ducks of dogs!&#8221; Or, &#8220;What loves of
little doggies!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the dogs came back again they were always
prouder then ever. They would tell me
how the different ladies had petted them and
praised them, and had given them bits of cake,&mdash;only
little bits, because the mistress said too much
cake wasn&#8217;t good for little doggies. They would
lick their lips and tell me how delicious the cake
was, until it made my mouth water to hear about
it.</p>

<p>Often after they had gone I would lie there and
think, &#8220;If I could only get in there once, without
Mary seeing me, I would soon show the people
what a clever little dog I am. I would grin, and
beg, and play dead dog. How surprised and
pleased they would all be! And the mistress,&mdash;she
would be pleased, too, and when she saw how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
smart everybody thought I was she&#8217;d be glad to
have me there. If only someone would think of
putting a piece of cake on my nose, then I could
show them that trick, too&mdash;the trick where I throw
the cake up in the air and catch it again&mdash;only of
course nobody knew about that, so they wouldn&#8217;t
think of trying it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I used to lie there in the nursery and dream
about it while the other little dogs were downstairs
having a good time.</p>

<p>One day all four of us dogs were up in Tommy&#8217;s
sitting-room (Mary and the mistress called it the
nursery, but Tommy called it the sitting-room),
and two or three times we heard the front door
open and shut and visitors talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if they&#8217;ll send for us?&#8221; said Fifine
lazily. &#8220;I just feel like a bit of cake this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was lying stretched out in Tommy&#8217;s chair.
I hated to see her there. That was my place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Bijou. &#8220;But if they <i>do</i>, I
hope Mary will brush my hair first. It looks rather
rough today, and it&#8217;s always so glossy when it&#8217;s
brushed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Mary came to the door. &#8220;Come,
Prince,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Come, Bijou and Fifine. The
mistress wants you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three little dogs jumped up and ran toward
her, and I did, too. I thought maybe this time
she would let me come along, but she just said,
&#8220;Go back, Muffins! You can&#8217;t come. You&#8217;re not
wanted&#8221;; and Prince Coco looked back and
snarled, &#8220;I should think you would have
learned by this time that you&#8217;re not a company
dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t say anything&mdash;just lay down again, but
I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you in a little while whether
I&#8217;m a company dog or not.&#8221; I&#8217;d made up my mind
that I&#8217;d get into the drawing-room this time in
spite of Mary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Tommy was away that afternoon. Sometimes
he didn&#8217;t come home till dinner time. I think he
went to visit other little boys.</p>

<p>I waited until Mary had had plenty of time to
take the others to the drawing-room and leave
them there, and then I got up and stole out into
the entry and down the stairs. There was no one
in the hall below, but I could hear the visitors
talking and laughing beyond the curtains of the
drawing-room door. I slipped between the curtain
and the side of the doorway, and then I was
in the room.</p>

<p>It was full of people talking and laughing, and
at first no one noticed me. The mistress was sitting
at a table pouring something into a cup. One
lady was sitting near her with Fifine in her lap,
and Prince Coco and Bijou were waiting in front
of the table for cake. A gentleman was standing
near the table with a cup in his hand. He was the
first one to notice me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s another little dog,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is this
your dog, too, Mrs. Stanford?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the mistress saw me. She gave a cry.
&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s that miserable little stray,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He
came here at the time of the blizzard, and howled
at the door. Tommy found him and brought him
in, and begged to keep him for awhile. I don&#8217;t
know how the dog managed to steal in here. Ring
the bell, please, for James to take him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she said that I knew I&#8217;d have to hurry if
I wanted the people to see my tricks, so first I
rolled over and played &#8220;dead dog,&#8221; and then I sat
up and grinned and waved my paws, and then I
barked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word! He&#8217;s a clever little chap,&#8221; said the
gentleman, and he tossed me a bit of cake.</p>

<p>It fell on the floor beside me, and quick as a flash
Bijou jumped to get it. But I was quicker than
he was. I growled and shoved him aside and
grabbed it up and swallowed it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_026fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>I sat up and waved my paws.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>I guess Bijou was disappointed and so he felt
like fighting me. Maybe he was jealous, too, because
the gentleman noticed me. At any rate before
I knew what he was going to do he jumped on
me with a snarl and bit me.</p>

<p>I was so surprised I tumbled over against the
gentleman, and he said, &#8220;My word!&#8221; and his teacup
upset and the hot tea came down on me.</p>

<p>The mistress cried out, &#8220;Oh, that miserable dog!
Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221; And then James came in, and
the mistress said, &#8220;James, take that dog out and
shut him up somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>James picked me up and carried me out, and he
held me so tight I yelped. Out in the hall he
dropped me and pushed me with his foot. &#8220;Go on
upstairs!&#8221; he said in a low, fierce voice. &#8220;Go on!&#8221;
And I ran up, and hid under the sofa in the nursery.
I was so miserable I didn&#8217;t know what to do.
I did hope the other dogs wouldn&#8217;t come up there.
I was ashamed to see them. But it hadn&#8217;t been my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fault; it was Bijou&#8217;s. Only nobody seemed to
think of that. If Tommy had been there he would
have known. I was his dog, and he loved me and
thought I was cute, even if nobody else did like me
or want to have me around.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; DIDN&#8217;T see the other dogs until the next
day. They came up in the nursery only now
and then,&mdash;mostly when there wasn&#8217;t any fire
in the drawing-room or when the mistress was out.</p>

<p>I think she must have been out the next afternoon,
and the fire, too, because they came trotting
upstairs soon after lunch and came in where I was.
I had jumped up in Tommy&#8217;s chair and was lying
there. I liked to lie in his chair, and someone had
laid a cushion on it that morning, so it was soft
and warm.</p>

<p>Fifine came over toward the chair and looked at
me in a snarly way, and I knew she wanted me to
get out of it and let her have it, but I wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Prince Coco sat down close against the radiator.
He always chose the hottest place. He yawned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and then he looked over at me in sort of a proud,
lazy way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself with the visitors
yesterday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Fighting before them
all, and upsetting the tea and everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>The way he said it made me so mad I couldn&#8217;t
help growling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly disgraceful,&#8221; snarled Fifine. &#8220;I
never was so ashamed in my life. I&#8217;m glad the
mistress told them you were Tommy&#8217;s dog, and
didn&#8217;t belong with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t answer,&mdash;just kept up a low growling.</p>

<p>Bijou didn&#8217;t say anything. I think he was
afraid. I kept watching him, and if he had said
anything I was going to jump on him and show
him which was the better dog. I was still mad at
him for biting me the day before. I think he knew
this, for he went over and lay down under the sofa,
and then presently he got up again and went out.</p>

<p>Prince Coco kept on mumbling, and I didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
know whether he was talking to himself or me.
&#8220;Oh, well! What&#8217;s the difference? They&#8217;re going
away this week, and then it&#8217;s good-bye Muffins.
You won&#8217;t be here long after they go.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did wish he would stop talking that way.</p>

<p>A door banged downstairs, and I heard Tommy
whistle for me. At once I forgot Prince Coco and
all he had been saying. I bounded out of my chair
and tore downstairs. There was Tommy waiting
for me below. He threw his school-books over on
a chair, and then we had a fine romp. We had the
rugs all tangled up together and the chairs crooked
before we were through.</p>

<p>It was several days before I thought any more
of what Prince Coco had said.</p>

<p>Then one morning I heard a bumping sound out
in the hall, and I ran out to see what was going on.
James was bringing a big leather box down the
stairs from the third story. Bijou was out there
watching him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s he bringing that box down for?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>Bijou and I were friendly again now. He was
often friendly with me when the other dogs were
not there, and I liked him better than the others,
even if he had bitten me that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a box, it&#8217;s a trunk,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Every
time the family is going away James brings the
trunks down and Mary put the clothes in them,
and then she shuts the trunks and men come and
take them away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So bringing down the trunks means people are
going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bijou.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Mistress and the Master, and Tommy,
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>That worried me.</p>

<p>James took that trunk into the mistress&#8217;s room,
and he went up and brought down another and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it in the master&#8217;s room, and then he brought still
another and put it in Tommy&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>He lifted the top of the one in Tommy&#8217;s room,
and took part of the trunk out and set it on the
floor.</p>

<p>I had followed him into Tommy&#8217;s room, and
after he went away I jumped in the trunk and
sniffed about, but I couldn&#8217;t tell much about it
except that it smelled of Tommy&#8217;s clothes.</p>

<p>After a while Mary came into the room. When
she saw me she said, &#8220;Get out of that, Muffins.
You&#8217;re too curious.&#8221;</p>

<p>I jumped out of the trunk and sat down by it
and watched her. She went over and opened
Tommy&#8217;s closet and his bureau drawers, and began
taking out his clothes and putting them in the
trunk. After a while she had it almost full. I sat
and watched her. Then she went out of the room
for something.</p>

<p>As soon as she had gone I got up and looked into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the trunk again. All those clothes of Tommy&#8217;s
were going, and if I were in the trunk I would
go, too.</p>

<p>Right away I knew what to do. I jumped into
the trunk and scratched up some of the clothes and
got down in a corner and put my head down underneath
them, and then I lay there and kept perfectly
still.</p>

<p>Soon Mary came back into the room. She moved
about and shut a bureau drawer, and then she came
over to the trunk. I could hear her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsch!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Whoever has been at this
trunk!&#8221; Then she lifted something off my head.
&#8220;Well I never!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t move, except that I couldn&#8217;t help shaking.
I just lay still and pretended I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>Tommy must have come home, for I heard his
whistle, but I only snuggled down still further in
the trunk, and hoped Mary would go away and
forget about me.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_034fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>I pretended I wasn&#8217;t there.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Presently he came upstairs, and I heard him
asking, &#8220;Where is Muffins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in here, Master Tommy!&#8221; called Mary.</p>

<p>He came in the room. I could tell by the sound,
though I didn&#8217;t lift my head or stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look in here,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>Tommy came over to the trunk and looked into
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little beggar!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;How did he get
in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have jumped in while I was out of the
room,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever know such a dog!&#8221; cried
Tommy.</p>

<p>A moment after he took hold of me. &#8220;Come out
of there, you little beggar,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I tried to get further down under the clothes,
but Tommy lifted me out. He was laughing in
a funny way, and he put his face against me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not the limit!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he knows I&#8217;m going away, Mary, and he wants to
go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of <i>course</i> that was what I wanted. I wouldn&#8217;t
have hidden in the trunk if I hadn&#8217;t hoped to go
along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I can&#8217;t take him,&#8221; said Tommy.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask mother whether I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can ask her, but you know she won&#8217;t let
you,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>I suppose she wouldn&#8217;t let him, for I know I
didn&#8217;t go.</p>

<p>The next day the automobile came to the door
early and the trunks were carried out, and then
Tommy and his father and mother came downstairs
with their hats on, and when I jumped up
on Tommy he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but you can&#8217;t go,
old fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>James caught me by the collar and pulled me
back. I almost snapped him, he bothered me so.
I did snarl and try to wriggle away from him, but
I couldn&#8217;t.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Then Mary opened the outside door and Tommy
and his father and mother went down the steps,
and when they were part way down Tommy looked
back and called, &#8220;Good-bye, Muffins! I&#8217;ll be back
soon. Take good care of him while I&#8217;m away,
James. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Mary shut the door, and they were
gone.</p>

<p>Prince Coco yawned and stretched himself.
&#8220;Well, now we&#8217;ll have some peace and quiet, with
Tommy out of the house!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>That made me so mad I growled and flew at
him, but James turned back and said, &#8220;Here!
Here! None of that! What&#8217;s the matter with
you, Muffins, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Coco didn&#8217;t say anything more about Tommy
after that. He was afraid to.</p>

<p>He may have liked having the house so quiet,
but I didn&#8217;t. I was so lonesome without Tommy
that I hardly knew what to do with myself. But
then he had said he would be back soon. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
had told James to take good care of me, so it was
all nonsense about their sending me away and
my not being there when Tommy came home
again.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; WAS up in Tommy&#8217;s room lying under the
bed with one of his shoes in my mouth. It
was one of his school shoes. I had dragged
it out of the closet one day when Mary left the
door open. I didn&#8217;t feel so lonesome when I had
it in my mouth. He had been gone for several
days now.</p>

<p>Well, I was lying there, and sometimes I chewed
the top of the shoe and sometimes I just held it,
and then I heard James whistling and calling me.</p>

<p>I wondered what he wanted, so I left the shoe
under the bed where it was safe and ran down
to see.</p>

<p>He was standing in the front hall, and Bijou
and Fifine were there, too. &#8220;Come along, Muffins,&#8221;
said James, and as soon as I came near enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for him to reach me he picked me up. He held
me under his arm and went over to the front door
and opened it.</p>

<p>The automobile was standing out in front of
the house, and Bijou and Fifine thought we were
going for a ride and they wanted to go too, but
James pushed them back with his foot and told
them to stay at home. He shut the door behind us
and went over to the automobile and got up in
front beside William. He put me down on his
knees but still he held me, and then we started
off.</p>

<p>I was very much excited. I had never been in
an automobile before. All the other dogs had.
I had often watched from the window and seen
them starting out with the mistress, but she never
took me.</p>

<p>We rolled along down the street, with William
holding the wheel, and there were other automobiles
and crowds of people, and I saw some other
dogs, too.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>The wind blew, and I was so excited I barked
and barked until James told me to be quiet, and
even then I didn&#8217;t stop till he held my mouth shut
with his hand.</p>

<p>After a while we turned into a narrower street
and stopped in front of a queer-looking shop. It
had a big window with a sort of cage in it with an
upstairs and a downstairs, and puppies and some
long-haired cats in it.</p>

<p>William stopped the automobile in front of the
shop. &#8220;This is the place,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then he got down and took me from James and
carried me into the shop. I never heard such a
noise as there was in there. It had cages all along
one side with dogs and cats in them, and some other
animals that I didn&#8217;t know, and the dogs were
barking and yelping, and big green birds were
shrieking, and there were chickens making a noise,
too.</p>

<p>A man came forward from the back of the shop,
and William said, &#8220;This is the dog.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>The man took me and looked at me. I didn&#8217;t
like him. He scared me and I growled at him, but
he didn&#8217;t pay any attention. &#8220;All right!&#8221; he said,
and then he opened the door of one of the cages
and put me in with a lot of other puppies.</p>

<p>He shut the door of the cage and fastened it,
and then he gave William some money. William
took it and put it in his pocket, but he kept looking
at me in a sorry sort of way, and he came up close
to the cage and put his fingers through, and said,
&#8220;Well&mdash;good-bye, Muffins, old chap.&#8221; Then he
turned away.</p>

<p>All of a sudden I knew he meant to leave me
there, and I lifted my nose and howled, and yelped
and howled again.</p>

<p>William looked back at me, and then he turned
to the man and asked him something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll be all right in a little while,&#8221; said
the man.</p>

<p>William looked at me once more in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sort of sorry way, and then he went out and the
door closed behind him.</p>

<p>He had gone and left me. But if only I could
get out of the cage I might still run after him.
I cried and whined and tore at the door with my
claws, but I couldn&#8217;t get it open.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt a cold nose against mine and
a little tongue licked my cheek. One of the other
puppies in the cage was trying to make friends
with me.</p>

<p>I stopped tearing at the door and sniffed at
him, and I liked his smell. He smelled friendly.</p>

<p>After we had smelled each other he gave a
sudden little frisk and tried to get me to play,
but I sat down and didn&#8217;t pay any more attention
to him. I felt too sad and lonely to care anything
about playing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you don&#8217;t like it here, do you?&#8221; said
the little dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, and I want to go home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here a long time; oh, a long, long
time,&#8221; said the puppy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you have a home?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t often think about it. I guess
maybe some time someone will take me away and
I may have another home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to stay here a long time,&#8221; I
said. It made me whine to think of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe you won&#8217;t. Some of the dogs
only stay here a little while. They just come here
and then they go away again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do they go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People come and get them. I guess they go
to different places.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_044fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>I felt too sad and lonely to care anything about playing.</i></p>

<p>I looked around the cage and saw there were
a great many puppies. None of them were alike.
Some were bigger than others, but none of them
were very big. They were almost all asleep,
some lying on top of others, but presently one of
them woke and yawned and got up. He didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pay any attention to me, but went over and took
a drink of water and licked at a plate that looked
as if food had been in it. Then he went back and
lay down again.</p>

<p>The friendly puppy and I talked together a
a long time. He told me his name was Fido. I
told him my name was Muffins.</p>

<p>He said the shop was a place where people
came when they wanted an animal. Some of
the dogs there were very fine dogs. I told him
about Fifine and Bijou and Prince Coco, and he
said some of the dogs in the cages around us were
just as fine as they were, if not finer. <i>We</i> weren&#8217;t,
though. None of the dogs in our cage were worth
much. He said there was a sign on the front of
our cage. He had heard people read it and he
knew what it said. It said:</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;Just plain dogs! Two dollars and a half
apiece.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>I asked him if people seemed to like plain dogs,
and he said no; they seemed to like the other dogs
better.</p>

<p>Well, it got on toward supper time and I grew
hungry. Every now and then I whined and yelped.
Then the man came along and put some food in
our cage, and the other dogs woke up and we all
ate from the plate together. One dog kept growling
all the while he ate, but nobody paid any
attention to him.</p>

<p>It grew dark in the shop and the man went away,
and all the animals were still.</p>

<p>Then came the morning and the noise began
again, and the man opened the shop and fed us.
People came and went. Sometimes they took a
dog or a cat or a bird away with them, but no one
took a puppy from our cage. They just looked
at us and read the sign and went on.</p>

<p>After a while we were turned out in a dark,
narrow yard to run about for a while, and then
we were put back in our cage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Every day it was just the same thing. After
awhile I began to sleep most of the time the way
the others did. They were stupid dogs, all but
Fido. He and I used to play together sometimes,
and I liked him. I liked him better than any dog
I had ever known.</p>

<p>After I had been there a while&mdash;not so very
long though&mdash;a queer-looking man and woman
came to the shop. The woman had a bright hat,
and the man had black hair, and eyes that made me
feel queer when he looked at me.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t look at me at first, though. He looked
at the finer dogs that were in open cages down
below us. They were chained there, and there
were no tops or fronts to the cages but just backs
and sides to keep the dogs from getting at each
other.</p>

<p>The man and woman stopped in front of
my cage, and the woman said, &#8220;How about a
poodle?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were looking at the dog just below us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8220;No, no! Ab-so-lutely no,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;We
already have two. That is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he raised his eyes and looked straight at
me. I was sitting at the front of the cage, and
when he looked at me I stood up and wagged my
tail and then I grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;See! See!&#8221; cried the man, and he caught the
woman by the arm. &#8220;It is he! The one we want.
His eyes, so full of intelligence! And that smile,
for it <i>is</i> a smile. There is our clown dog. Just the
one we want!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and snapped his fingers, and called
to the shopman in a quick, sharp voice.</p>

<p>The man came hurrying toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This one,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;The little dog
with the black around his eye. Take him out that
I may see him!&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_048fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>I grinned at him.</i></p>

<p>The shopman took me out and gave me to the
man, and the man held me up close to his face and
looked into my eyes and smiled at me, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
grinned at him. I liked him, though he had a
queer look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is the one,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;We
will take him. Have you a basket in which to
carry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shopman had. It was a queer basket. I
had never seen one like it before. It was just big
enough to hold me, and it had a cover, and a
window at one end so I could look out.</p>

<p>The stranger put me in it and fastened the lid.</p>

<p>He let the basket stand on the floor while he
paid the shopman, and then he picked it up and
started off. I should have liked to say good-bye
to Fido, but I had no chance. I looked out of
the window and I could see him up in the cage
looking after me, but he couldn&#8217;t see me very well.</p>

<p>It was a long time before we ever saw each other
again, and when we did it was in the queerest way.
But that comes later in my story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SO now I belonged to Mr. Bonelli, and had
still another name given me. I was now
called Master Grineo. It seemed funny
to have belonged to so many people, and to have
had so many names. Every time there was a new
master there was a new name.</p>

<p>First I had belonged to Mr. O&#8217;Grady and then
I had been called Smarty. Next I had belonged to
Tommy and then I was called Muffins. And now
it was Mr. Bonelli and I was Master Grineo.</p>

<p>The first thing my new master taught me was
to answer to that name, and to pay attention the
moment he said &#8220;<i>Master Grineo</i>.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_050fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Mr. Bonelli had a lot of dogs beside me.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli had a lot of dogs beside me. Some
of them were big, and some were little. I was
afraid of them at first, there were so many of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
but they were very friendly dogs,&mdash;not proud and
snarly like Prince Coco and Fifine.</p>

<p>They were all trained dogs, and could do a great
many wonderful tricks. Mr. Bonelli had trained
them. After they were trained he took them to
a big place called a theatre, and crowds and
crowds of people came to see them do their tricks.
Showing off his dogs was Mr. Bonelli&#8217;s business,
just as going to the factory was Mr. O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s
business.</p>

<p>Soon after I came to live with Mr. Bonelli he
began to teach me tricks. He began with easy
tricks, almost as easy as the ones Mr. O&#8217;Grady
had taught me, but he went on to harder and
harder ones. Some of them were very hard indeed,
and some were funny. I never knew there were
so many tricks a dog could learn. And the other
dogs knew just as many as I did. At least some
of them didn&#8217;t know as many, but some of them
knew more. I had thought I was smart when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
learned those three little tricks Mr. O&#8217;Grady had
taught me, but I knew better now. I heard Mr.
Bonelli say he had never had a dog that learned
as quickly as I did.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bonelli lived in a big house, but
they didn&#8217;t live in all of it. They lived downstairs
and some other people lived upstairs. There
was a man upstairs who played a horn. When he
played it I felt so sad it made me howl, but Mr.
Bonelli always spoke sharply to me when I did
that, so after a while I learned I mustn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Back of the house was a yard, and every day
we dogs were turned out there to run about awhile
and get the fresh air. Trained dogs act just like
any other dogs. They sniff about and play together,
only never fight. Mr. Bonelli wouldn&#8217;t
allow any fighting.</p>

<p>The dog I liked best was a little black dog
named Sambo. He was just about my size, and we
played together a great deal. We were great friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Besides Sambo there was a poodle named Punch,
and a terrier named Frisco; then there were Ruby&mdash;he
was a setter&mdash;and Snaps, and Diamond, and
Sancho and Frolic. I don&#8217;t know what kinds of
dogs they were. There was a long-legged greyhound,
too, who could jump further than any dog
I ever saw. His name was Graceful.</p>

<p>There had been another dog, but he had died,
and that is the reason Mr. Bonelli had come to the
shop and had bought me.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bonelli first began to teach me my
tricks he took me off in a quiet room by myself;
but when I had once learned them, I had to do
them before all the other dogs with Mrs. Bonelli
making loud music on a piano.</p>

<p>At first it was harder to do it there before the
others, and I made mistakes; but I soon became
used to it, and then it wasn&#8217;t any harder to pay attention
with all the others there than when I was
in a room alone with Mr. Bonelli.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">EVERY day Mr. Bonelli took all of us
down into a big cellar under the house.</p>

<p>There was a raised part at one end that
he called a stage, and we had to get up on the stage
and go through our tricks every day. If any dog
made a mistake he had to go through his tricks all
over again.</p>

<p>We all had sort of fancy things to wear when we
were on the stage.</p>

<p>The other dogs wore cloth collars that came
down over their breasts and a kind of saddle
strapped around them. The collars and saddles
were red, and had trimming around the edges.</p>

<p>I was dressed differently, because I was the
clown dog. I wore a red cap that was cut so that
it came round and fastened under my chin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a big white thing round my neck that they called
a ruff. I wore a little coat with my front legs put
through the sleeves of it, and little striped trousers
with my tail coming through at the back.</p>

<p>At first, when they dressed me that way, I felt
so foolish I wanted to get down under a chair or
sofa and hide, but afterwards I became used to it,
and then I felt quite proud, and liked to be dressed
in them.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli made me the clown dog because
I could grin. The first thing he taught me was to
grin whenever he made a certain sign with a little
whip he always carried.</p>

<p>When he was teaching me he used to give me a
bit of cake or sugar every time I grinned, so I was
always glad when he made the sign for me to do it.
But afterwards he stopped giving me the cake and
sugar, but I had to grin just the same.</p>

<p>As soon as we were on the stage we had to run
over to a row of chairs and jump up on them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
There was a chair for each dog, and each dog had
his own particular chair. We were never allowed
to sit on any but our own chairs.</p>

<p>All the dogs except me sat with their backs
against the backs of the chairs and their tails hanging
down, but when I got up in my chair I turned
with my head to the back of it and my tail toward
the front. That was what I had been taught to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli would call to me and tell me to turn
around, but I wouldn&#8217;t stir. He would call to me
louder and louder, as if he was getting angry, but I
wouldn&#8217;t pay any attention. At last he would
come over and lift me up and set me down the right
way, but as soon as he went away I would turn
around again. We would do this several times,
and at last he would say, &#8220;All right, Master
Grineo, suit yourself then,&#8221; and would walk away
and leave me.</p>

<p>Then I would turn round and sit the right way
and grin at him, and he would seem very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
surprised when he looked round and saw me sitting
that way.</p>

<p>Later, when we acted in a theatre with people
looking on, I found this trick always made the
people laugh.</p>

<p>(Mr. Bonelli didn&#8217;t call it a trick, though; he
called it an &#8220;act.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Another &#8220;act&#8221; we did was the Jumping Act.</p>

<p>A long board would be put on the stage with
one end resting on something high so that it stuck
up in the air. A mattress was always laid on the
stage down below the high end. The dogs would
run up the board and jump off on the mattress.
The mattress was put there so they wouldn&#8217;t hurt
their legs when they came down.</p>

<p>All the dogs would jump except me, but I would
just sit and look on.</p>

<p>Then the mattress would be moved further off,
and a chair would be put between it and the board.
The dogs would run up the board and jump off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
end and out over the chair and light on the mattress
as before. Then the mattress would be moved
further and two chairs put there. The little dogs
would stop jumping then. But most of the larger
dogs kept on.</p>

<p>Then two chairs and a table would be put there
for them to jump over, and then two chairs and
two tables, and so on. After a while the jumps
would be so long that only Graceful and Punch
could do them. They were both fine jumpers, but
Graceful was the best.</p>

<p>Now I would get down from my chair and trot
over to Mr. Bonelli and stand up on my hind legs
in front of him and bark: &#8220;Bow-wow-wow-wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Grineo!&#8221; he would say. &#8220;You want to
try it, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bow-wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s too long a jump for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bow-wow-wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you can do it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8220;Bow-wow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well! Then go ahead, but I&#8217;m afraid you
can&#8217;t do it, and you may hurt yourself, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I would go back to the furthest edge of
the stage, and run as hard as I could across the
stage and up the board, and just as I got to the
edge I would stop short and stand there with all
my feet together and not jump at all. Then I
would look round at Mr. Bonelli and grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he would say. &#8220;I knew you couldn&#8217;t
do it. Come down now and let Graceful jump.&#8221;
But I wouldn&#8217;t come down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come!&#8221; he would cry impatiently.
&#8220;You&#8217;re keeping everybody waiting. Come down,
I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still I wouldn&#8217;t move, and then Graceful would
run up the board and jump right over me and far
out over the chairs and tables, and land on the
mattress so lightly you scarcely knew when he
touched it. Even Punch was not able to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that last long jump, only Graceful. After that
last jump I would come down from the board and
go back to my chair again.</p>

<p>Then we would play ball. Mr. Bonelli would
toss a big bright ball to one after another of the
dogs, and each dog would jump up in the air and
catch it and bring it back to him.</p>

<p>After they had played for a while I would jump
down from my chair and run over in front of
him, and stand up on my hind legs and wave
my paws.</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; he would cry. &#8220;You want to play, too,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bow-wow-wow!&#8221; I would bark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he would say; &#8220;then catch.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would throw the ball to me, and I would
catch it as the others had done, but instead of bringing
it back to him I would run away with it, and
he would chase me all around the stage and pretend
to get very angry.</p>

<p>At last he would cry, &#8220;Police! Police!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_060fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Graceful would jump right over me.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Then Frolic, who had jumped down from his
chair and had run out a little while before, would
come in walking on his hind legs and dressed like
a policeman. A black stick was strapped to his
paw, and he would come hopping over toward me
and wave the stick as if he meant to hit me, and I
would pretend to be frightened and would drop
the ball and run and hide under a chair.</p>

<p>Frolic would go out again, and after he had gone
I would come out from under the chair and sit
down in front of Mr. Bonelli, and beg again and
wave my paws up and down.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli would say, &#8220;So you want to play
again. Sure you won&#8217;t run away with the ball
this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>I would wave my paws harder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, we&#8217;ll try once more, but remember!
If you play any more of your tricks I&#8217;ll call the
policeman again, and then he&#8217;ll take you away and
shut you in the lock-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now would come the most difficult trick I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ever had to learn. It was one that none of the other
dogs could do. I don&#8217;t know whether any other
dog ever did it or not. When Mr. Bonelli threw
the ball to me this time, I would catch it and throw
it back to him. This I would do by jerking my
head forward and letting go of the ball at the same
time. We would throw it backward and forward
three or four times, and then we would stop, for
it was hard for me to do this, and after doing it
three or four times I was tired.</p>

<p>After that I would rest awhile, and some of the
other dogs would do their tricks. A long red carpet
would be unrolled across the stage, and Frisco, and
Snaps, and Diamond and Sancho would turn
somersaults across it from one side of the stage to
the other.</p>

<p>After they had done this for a while they would
stop and go back to their chairs, and three little
round barrels painted with stripes of red, white
and blue would be brought in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>This was an act for Sambo and Frolic and me.
We would get on top of the barrels and roll them
along with our feet from one end of the carpet to
the other, always keeping on top of them and never
falling off. That was a hard thing to do.</p>

<p>Then Graceful and Ruby would come in dressed
like people. Graceful was the lady, with a skirt,
and a hat with a feather in it, and Ruby was the
gentleman, in a coat and trousers. Graceful&#8217;s dress
was so long at the back that it trailed on the floor.
The music played and they stood up on their hind
legs and danced together, and after I had watched
them for a while I would jump down and hop after
them on my hind legs, and every now and then
I would hop on Graceful&#8217;s train so he couldn&#8217;t
dance and at last he would have to stop and run
off the stage on all fours.</p>

<p>These are some of the acts we did, but there were
a great many more of them.</p>

<p>The last of all was the &#8220;Fire Act.&#8221; A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
house would be brought on the stage, and Mr.
Bonelli would pretend to set fire to it. It was
fixed so it wouldn&#8217;t really burn, but the fire was
inside and came out of the windows, so it looked
as though it were burning.</p>

<p>Then Graceful and Ruby would come galloping
in harnessed to a little fire engine, with Sancho
sitting up in front with the reins in his paws.
Diamond stood on the back of the fire engine and
kept pushing a gong with his paw so it went &#8220;Jang!
jang! jang! jang! jang!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a hose on the engine, and Judy had
to catch it in her teeth and hold it so that when
the water was turned on it would squirt on the
house and seem to put the fire out.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_064fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>We would get on top of the barrels and roll them along with
our feet.</i></p>

<p>I was the little dog that ran about barking when
the house was burning, and then pushed the other
little dog off the engine and rang the bell myself.
We none of us liked this act because of the fire.
We were afraid of the fire. Still we had to do as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
we were told, and we had to practise this act over
and over and over again because it was a hard one.</p>

<p>There were a great many other tricks besides
these, as I said, but these are enough to show you
the sort of things we did.</p>

<p>Every day we practised these things over and
over until every one of us knew exactly what he
was to do and when he was to do it.</p>

<p>Then one morning we didn&#8217;t practise. We
played out in the yard and around the house, and
we didn&#8217;t have any lessons.</p>

<p>In the afternoon two men came to the house,
and Mr. Bonelli called to us and whistled us into
the room where he and the men were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my children!&#8221; said he. (He often called
us his children.) &#8220;This afternoon we go to the
theatre to practise, and we will see whether you
can be as perfect there as here. Then tonight we
will act in the show, and everybody will look and
laugh and wonder at you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>I didn&#8217;t know what he meant, but he looked so
kind and smiling I thought he must mean play. I
guess the other dogs did, too, because we all began
to bark and jump about him.</p>

<p>I did like Mr. Bonelli, but I didn&#8217;t love him the
way I loved Tommy. I never could love anyone
else the way I had loved Tommy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonelli came up from downstairs carrying
in her arms the things we wore, and she and Mr.
Bonelli dressed us. After that Mr. Bonelli put
collars on our necks and fastened straps to them,
and he and the men took hold of the straps and
led us out of the house and into the wide, sunny
street. How big and bright it seemed! I hadn&#8217;t
been in the street for a long time.</p>

<p>We trotted along, the men leading some of us
and Mr. Bonelli leading some, and everybody
turned to stare at us and smiled, and a crowd of
children followed after us, talking and calling.
Some of them wanted to pat us, but Mr. Bonelli
wouldn&#8217;t let them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>After a while we came to the theatre. I had
never been in a theatre before, and I didn&#8217;t know
what the name meant at first, but I learned afterward.
It is a great big place where crowds of
people come to see dogs act. There is always a
stage in a theatre, and bright lights. There are
queer places back of the stage, and men hurry about
and drag things round.</p>

<p>I was scared when I first saw it all and I stayed
close to Mr. Bonelli&#8217;s legs and kept looking up at
him, but the other dogs were used to it, they had
been there before so many times. They sniffed
about, and some of the men stopped and patted
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli led us out on the stage, and then
some men came with our chairs and set them in
a row.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my children!&#8221; said Mr. Bonelli.</p>

<p>He pointed to the chairs and flicked his little
whip, and we ran and got up in our places, only
I forgot and sat down with my head turned toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
him and my tail toward the back of the chair just
the way the other dogs were sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli wasn&#8217;t pleased with that. He spoke
to me quite sharply, and then I remembered and
turned round the other way,&mdash;the way he had
taught me to sit.</p>

<p>The lights shone out along the edge of the stage
and there was music somewhere in front of us, but
Mr. Bonelli spoke to us just the way he always did.
He came and turned me round in my chair, and
when I turned back again he said, &#8220;All right,
Master Grineo; suit yourself!&#8221; just as he did when
we were at home, and so presently I didn&#8217;t feel
strange any more.</p>

<p>We went through all our tricks as we did at
home, and when we came to the end Mr. Bonelli
went about among us, patting us and praising us.
&#8220;Good! Good dogs! Well done!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>We all felt so pleased we wagged our tails, and
some of us jumped about and barked. Then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
went home and had our suppers and lay down and
rested for a while.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t all. Almost always when we
had gone through our tricks once we had finished
for the day; but that evening the men came to
the house again, and Mr. Bonelli put collars and
straps on us,&mdash;but he didn&#8217;t dress us in our fancy
things this time. Mrs. Bonelli put the things in a
big case and fastened it, and then we all set out,
Mrs. Bonelli too.</p>

<p>We went the same way we had gone in the morning,
and after we came to the theatre Mrs. Bonelli
took us to a room downstairs, dressed us, and then
upstairs again where the stage was.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t go on the stage right away, though.
A man and woman were out on it. They were
walking up and down and singing and talking.
After a while they came off and went on again and
came off, and then a big curtain came down in
front so the stage was shut in like a room.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mr. Bonelli, &#8220;get those chairs on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some men ran about and carried our chairs out
on the stage. One of them almost fell over me.</p>

<p>Then the big curtain that had come down in
front of the stage went up again, and Mr. Bonelli
led us out on the stage.</p>

<p>He motioned to us to get up in our chairs and
we did, and then I heard him speaking and a big
noise as though a lot of people were clapping their
hands. It made me feel so queer inside I wanted
to turn round and bark and bark.</p>

<p>Then we began acting just as we did at home,
and every now and then there would be the same
sound of clapping hands. There were crowds and
crowds of people out in front of the stage. Sometimes
when I did my tricks they laughed and
clapped, and then I wagged my tail and grinned.
I wanted to do them over again but Mr. Bonelli
wouldn&#8217;t let me.</p>

<p>Sometimes there was music. It was bigger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
when Mrs. Bonelli played the piano. When we
rolled the barrels and when we turned somersaults
there was music. And when the dogs jumped off
the board the big drum went &#8220;Bumb!&#8221; And there
was music when Graceful and Ruby danced.</p>

<p>After a while it was all over, and we had to go
off the stage. I didn&#8217;t want to go off one bit, but
we had to. When the music began again I barked
and ran out on the stage again, but a man ran after
me and caught hold of me and pulled me back,
and everybody laughed.</p>

<p>Then the collars were fastened around our necks,
and the men came and took hold of the straps and
we went home again.</p>

<p>That was our first night of acting. But there
were many more after that. We acted for a long
time at that same theatre. Night after night we
acted there, and sometimes in the afternoons, too.
I got so used to it that I didn&#8217;t think any more
about it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Mr. Bonelli and Mrs. Bonelli
took us out along the street to a house
where we had never been before. We
went upstairs to a big light room with a window at
the top, and there was a man there with a big box
that stood up high on legs.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli got up on a little stage and called
us dogs up, and made us sit down around him.</p>

<p>The man stood in front of us and pulled a cloth
over the box and over his head. He looked so
strange that I began to bark,&mdash;not a big bark, but
a growling bark with my mouth shut; but Mr.
Bonelli told me to keep still.</p>

<p>Something in the box went &#8220;click,&#8221; and the man
took his head out from under the cloth and said,
&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll take another in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Mr. Bonelli wouldn&#8217;t let us get down from the
stage, and presently the man did the same thing
all over again.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Bonelli dressed us in our acting
things, and we had to get up on the stage and do
different tricks. I had to stand up on a high stool
and grin, and I had to stand on my hind legs and
grin.</p>

<p>The man put his head under the cloth again,
and the box went &#8220;click.&#8221; He did this over and
over. Then at last he said, &#8220;There! That&#8217;s all.
We ought to get some very good photographs out
of those.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what he meant.</p>

<p>After that Mrs. Bonelli took off our clothes and
we all went home again.</p>

<p>We had been going to the theatre every day for
a long time now, and I thought we would always
keep on going just the same way, and then one
time Mr. and Mrs. Bonelli got out their trunks
and packed them. I wondered whether they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
going away to leave us the way Tommy and his
father and mother had.</p>

<p>They did go away; it seems that&#8217;s what trunks
mean; but they took us with them. We went down
to a big place called a station where there were
engines that puffed and blew. A big train came
in and there was a great noise, and Mr. and Mrs.
Bonelli led us up some steps and into a sort of
long room they called a car. Presently it began
to shake and jolt, and everything outside began
sliding past the windows. It was very curious.</p>

<p>When we got out&mdash;that was after a long, long
time&mdash;we were in a strange place where I never
had been before. There were streets and houses,
but they were all strange, and they smelled strange.</p>

<p>We went to a big house Mr. Bonelli called a
hotel, and the trunks came after we did, and everything
was taken out of them again.</p>

<p>We stayed there at that hotel for a long time,
and almost right away we began going to a theatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to act. It wasn&#8217;t the same theatre as the one where
we had been before, but it was like it and people
came to watch us just as they had at the
first theatre.</p>

<p>After that we often rode on the cars. We went
to a great many different places, and always there
was a theatre, and always we went through just
the same tricks in just the same way, and there were
lights and music, and the people clapped their
hands and laughed.</p>

<p>All the while I remembered Tommy, but I didn&#8217;t
remember him as often as I used to. I was too
busy, and then I was tired all the time, too.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER a while we came back home again.
We didn&#8217;t begin acting right away,
though. We practised one or two new
tricks. I learned to turn somersaults and to
balance a ball on my nose.</p>

<p>Then one night we went to the theatre again.
We went quite early that night, and we went by a
different way from the way we had gone before.
I don&#8217;t know why that was. We used to go through
a narrow dark street with ash barrels standing in
it, and in through the back door of the theatre;
but this time we went along a broad bright street
where there were crowds of people, and Mr.
Bonelli led us in the big front way.</p>

<p>There were big boards standing in the hall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the theatre, with pictures on them,&mdash;and one was a
picture of <i>me</i>! Me, in my clown clothes up on a
high stool and grinning. The other dogs were
sniffing about and didn&#8217;t see it, and I wouldn&#8217;t
have seen it only Mr. Bonelli stooped and picked
me up in his arms. &#8220;Now look! Look at yourself,
my little clown dog,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Is it not a
good likeness?&#8221; And he took hold of my head
and turned it toward the picture.</p>

<p>I knew it was me because of the clown clothes,
and the spots of black.</p>

<p>I began to bark, and Mr. Bonelli turned to one
of the men and said, &#8220;He knows it,&mdash;he knows it,
my little Master Grineo. Never before was such
a dog as he,&#8221; and then he dropped me gently and
we went on into the theatre.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp; HAD learned more about theatres now than
I had known at first, and I had learned the
names of a great many things about it.</p>

<p>The bright lights in front of the stage were
called footlights. Then at each side of the stage
were places called &#8220;boxes,&#8221; and they had chairs in
them where people could sit, if they wanted to be
very near the stage. When they sat in the boxes
they were so near it was almost as though they
were on the stage with us. Often there were a lot
of children there, and I liked that because they
laughed so loud and clapped their hands so hard
when we did our tricks. But I didn&#8217;t pay so very
much attention to anyone but Mr. Bonelli when I
was on the stage. None of us did. We had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
watch him and his little whip all the time if we
were to do the right things.</p>

<p>This evening we had come with just our collars
on, and we ran downstairs to the room where Mrs.
Bonelli was and she dressed us, and we stayed
down there with her until it was time for our act.
Then Mr. Bonelli called us. We all ran upstairs
together and out on the stage, wagging our tails.
It was all just the way it had always been before,
but somehow I felt different, and all excited. I
kept sniffing and sniffing, and I felt as if Tommy
was somewhere near.</p>

<p>We jumped up on our chairs, and Mr. Bonelli
spoke to the people and they clapped, and then he
came over and turned me round, and I kept turning
back just the way I always did, until he said,
&#8220;All right, Master Grineo, suit yourself then!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that I turned and faced the people, just as
I always did, and grinned, and right then I heard
Tommy&#8217;s voice. He was there in the box beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the stage, and he called out, and his voice was
shrill,&mdash;&#8220;It is! It is, mamma! It&#8217;s Muffins!&#8221;</p>

<p>When I heard that I forgot everything. I
jumped down and ran over to the box where
Tommy was sitting, and jumped up against the
side of it and barked and whined and tried to get
to him; and he leaned down over the side of the
box to get at me and reached down his hand to pat
me, and I caught his hand in my mouth, I was so
glad to see him.</p>

<p>Then the next thing Mr. Bonelli called to me
sharp and quick, and came over toward me and
made his whip whistle through the air.</p>

<p>I was scared and ran back with my tail between
my legs and jumped up on the chair again.</p>

<p>The people in front began to talk and then the
music struck up, and Mr. Bonelli went over and
talked to Tommy. I didn&#8217;t hear what he said, but
presently he turned to the people and held up his
hand for the music to stop, and said, &#8220;My little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
clown dog found an old friend he had not seen
for a long time. He forgot himself, but now he
prays for you to forgive him, and he is ready to act
again,&#8221; and all the people clapped.</p>

<p>So we went on. Graceful jumped, and we
played ball and turned somersaults, and we rolled
the barrels and did all the rest of the things, but
I didn&#8217;t do very well, and once I fell off the barrel,
and once I missed the ball. Mr. Bonelli kept
smiling, but he came close to me and spoke to me
in a low voice, but very sharp, and touched me
with his whip, and then I did better.</p>

<p>At last It was all over. Mr. Bonelli bowed and
the people clapped, and he bowed and bowed, and
then we ran off the stage, and there, waiting for
us, were Tommy and his father.</p>

<p>The father talked to Mr. Bonelli, and Tommy
was down beside me patting me, and he kept saying,
&#8220;<i>Can&#8217;t</i> I have him back, father? <i>Can&#8217;t</i> I?&#8221;
until his father told him to be quiet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>He talked to Mr. Bonelli for a long time,
Tommy&#8217;s father did; then he called Tommy to
come, and I heard him say to Mr. Bonelli, &#8220;Then
I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy didn&#8217;t want to go, but he had to. He
kept looking back at me, and when I saw he was
going I wanted to follow him, but Mr. Bonelli
wouldn&#8217;t let me. He put on my collar and strap,
and I had to go home with him and Mrs. Bonelli
and the other dogs.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t the end of it. The next day
Tommy and his father came to Mr. Bonelli&#8217;s house.
I was sitting on the sill of the front window looking
out, and I saw them coming.</p>

<p>I jumped down and ran out into the hall to meet
them.</p>

<p>When they came in I whined and barked and
wagged my tail and jumped up on Tommy, and
he was just as glad to see me as I was to see him.</p>

<p>We went into a room and Tommy and his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and Mr. Bonelli sat down and talked. I wanted to
get up in the chair with Tommy, but Mr. Bonelli
wouldn&#8217;t let me. He took me up on his knees, and
all the while he was talking he kept smoothing me
and gently pulling my ears.</p>

<p>At last Tommy and his father stood up, and Mr.
Bonelli, too, and I scrambled down and ran over
to Tommy, and Tommy caught his father by the
arm and cried, &#8220;Can&#8217;t I take him now? Please!&#8221;</p>

<p>But his father shook his head. &#8220;You&#8217;ve heard
what Mr. Bonelli says; he&#8217;ll have to train a dog
to take his place before he can let him go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he and Mr. Bonelli shook hands, and
Tommy said good-bye, and Tommy and his father
went out and shut the door after them.</p>

<p>I wanted to go with them, but Mr. Bonelli held
me back. When he let me go I ran to the door and
scratched and whined, but I couldn&#8217;t get it open,
and at last I sat down and howled, but all my
howling did not bring them back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>It was not long after this when Mr. Bonelli
brought home another dog to the house. He was
a little brown dog just about my size. At first I
thought he was a strange dog, but when I went
up and sniffed at him he smelled like a friend.
Then he began to wag his tail, and frisk in front
of me, and all of a sudden I knew who he was. He
was little Fido from the dog shop.</p>

<p>I was so glad to see him I whined, and he seemed
just as glad to see me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my Grineo, so you remember your little
friend from the shop,&#8221; said Mr. Bonelli. &#8220;I had
forgotten that you were there together.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was very happy that Fido had come there to
live and to learn to be a trained dog. I knew he
would like it.</p>

<p>Right away Mr. Bonelli began to teach Fido the
same tricks that I had been doing. He worked and
worked with him. He taught him everything I
knew except to grin and to throw the ball. Fido<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
couldn&#8217;t learn to do either of those things. He and
I worked together, and he used to watch everything
I did, and try to do it the same way. I don&#8217;t know
just how long it took him to learn, but not so very
long. He was a smart little dog, but not as smart
as me. I heard Mr. Bonelli say to Mrs. Bonelli,
&#8220;Ah, yes; he is quick, but not quick as is my little
clown dog. There is but one Grineo, and I was
foolish when I promised to sell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Bonelli said, &#8220;But it is much money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then one day, after Fido had learned all the
tricks he seemed able to learn, an automobile came
to the door, and in it was William sitting in front,
and Tommy sat up beside him.</p>

<p>Tommy came in and I ran to meet him. At first
he just spoke to me and patted me, but I jumped
up at him and barked and yelped until he took
me up in his arms, and then I hardly knew what
to do, I was so glad.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Bonelli came in, and Tommy put me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
down and gave Mr. Bonelli an envelope. &#8220;Father
said to give you this,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonelli opened the envelope and took out
a piece of paper and looked at it, and Mrs. Bonelli
looked at it, too, and they both seemed pleased,
and Mr. Bonelli said, &#8220;That is all right; and please
thank your father for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they both said good-bye to me, and Mrs.
Bonelli took me up and kissed me, and I licked her
cheek, but I was so happy I barked and squirmed,
and she had to put me down, for now I somehow
knew that I was to go with Tommy, and be his
little dog again, and I wanted to be down where
I could jump on him if I chose, and follow close
at his heels.</p>

<p>I was close at his heels when he went out to the
automobile again, and when he opened the door
I jumped in before he did, I was so afraid I might
be left behind.</p>

<p>William seemed glad to see me. He said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
&#8220;Hello, Muffins! So you&#8217;re coming back to us,
are you?&#8221; And I barked and barked till Tommy
told me to be quiet.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed glad to see me at home, too,
and even the maid smiled and stooped to pat me,
and Bijou came up and put his nose to mine and
sniffed at me in a friendly way.</p>

<p>There had been great changes in the house since
I was there. Prince Coco was gone, and Fifine was
gone. Bijou told me what had become of them.
Prince Coco had eaten so much that he got sick,
and had been sent away. He always had eaten
too much. And Fifine had had five little puppies,
so she had been sent away to the gardener out in
the country.</p>

<p>So now Bijou and I were the only dogs in the
house, and Bijou was very friendly with me all
the time. He said he had wanted to be friendly
before, and to play and have some fun with me,
only he was ashamed to before the other dogs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>I couldn&#8217;t play with him so <i>very</i> much even now,
though, because when Tommy was home I had
to play with him the most.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t know that I would ever see Mr. Bonelli
again, but I did. He came to the house several
times. What he came for was to show Tommy how
to put me through my tricks.</p>

<p>The first time he came he brought a little whip
just like his own for Tommy, and he brought a
little barrel striped red, white and blue, and it was
my own little barrel that I used to act on. There
were one or two tricks I couldn&#8217;t do at home because
we hadn&#8217;t the things, like the jumping-board
act and the fire act, but Mr. Bonelli showed
Tommy how to put me through almost all the
others. Tommy was pleased, and so was I. I
grinned and grinned.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_088fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Tommy used to make me go through my tricks.</i></p>

<p>And now I was allowed to go any place in the
house that I wanted to, they were all so proud of
me. I could even go into the drawing-room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
sleep on the chairs if I wished to, and sometimes
when there were visitors Tommy used to take me
in and make me go through my tricks, and the
people laughed and I grinned, and the ladies gave
me pieces of cake.</p>

<p>Prince Coco I never saw again. He never came
back from the place they had sent him to; but
Fifine came back after a while, and when she saw
how everybody liked me she liked me, too, and I
was very happy. But Tommy was the one I loved&mdash;oh,
ever so much better than all the rest of them
together, for I was his little dog, and I was called
Muffins again because we liked that name and he
had given it to me. First Smarty with Mr.
O&#8217;Grady, and then Muffins with Tommy, and then
Master Grineo with Mr. Bonelli, and now for
always Tommy&#8217;s own little Muffins again.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
